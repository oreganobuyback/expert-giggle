    <h1>I Don’t Draw, I Actually Suck at It Quite a Bit</h1>

<p>In recent months, I've been practicing quite a few skills such as drawing, photography, designing, coding, Japanese language, reading, and I think that’s about it. Perhaps writing—though I see these posts more as an expression of thoughts.</p>

<p>In the upcoming weeks, I'll share my experiences with each skill and the reasons behind my start in them.</p>

<p><b>Drawing:</b></p>

<p>Drawing served as my entry point into what now takes up much of my time: design. Many people in school considered me the kid who could draw, but truthfully I was mediocre at best, producing mostly copies and tracings.</p>

<p>This disconnect between my actual abilities and others' perception resulted in my first encounter with imposter syndrome.</p>

<p>Throughout high school, I tried to become the artist I had falsely presented myself as, only to experience years of frustration and a desire for approval.</p>

<p>As high school came to a close, I grew to hate the stress drawing induced for me. Each drawing had a single goal: perfection to impress others. After graduation, I quit drawing completely and made it very clear to anyone who asked, "I don't draw, I actually suck at it quite a bit.”</p>

<p>The first time I said this, a weight was lifted. I didn’t need to be great anymore.</p>

<p class="subtext">Fast forward to March 2023</p>

<p>I've avoided drawing for years, almost developing a fear of it.</p>

<p>Until a few weeks ago, I stumbled upon a video titled "How to learn to draw – and why you should." Danny Gregory does an amazing job painting a new perspective on drawing. He conveys drawing as a meditative process that allows one to slow down and immerse oneself in the moment, unattached to the image's outcome.</p>

<p>Drawing can be a language, a means of expression akin to writing, speaking, or sign language—a universal language. Most of us know how to speak, write, and read at least one language, but about what drawing?</p>

<p class="subtext">"I suck at drawing,"</p> 
<p class="subtext">"I can only draw stick figures."</p>

<p>Not Danny, he believes anyone can draw.</p>

<p>All he recommends is a sketchbook, a magic pen, and something in front of you.</p>

<p>So immediately after finishing the video I sprung out of bed, drove to the nearest stationery store, and bought myself just that. I sat outside the store, unpackaged all my supplies, and began drawing what was in front of me.</p>

<p>As soon as my pen hit the paper, I began to hear the usual doubts. But then, I recalled that these questions didn't matter. I wasn't seeking greatness like before; I sought a deeper connection with the present moment, free from external expectations.</p>

<p>The drawing was far from impressive, but for the first time, I felt at peace creating imperfect art. There was no frustration or disappointment, only acceptance. I closed my sketchbook, leaving the past behind and anticipating the next drawing.</p>

<p>Since then, I've been drawing every other day, improving my skills and producing artwork that makes me proud—some I never thought possible. More importantly, I've gained the ability to leave the past behind, embrace the future, and focus on what's ahead. A new perspective on the learning process: to embrace it, delight in the journey, and appreciate both the triumphs and failures that come with it.</p>
