<p>I do this a lot.</p>

<p>Create these unrealistic goals to, find some sort of motivation.</p>

<p>But in reality, they just leave me feeling failure and frustration.</p>

<p>Because even in those moments where I complete my goals on time,</p>
    
<blockquote class="subtext"><em>Contentment only visits until I find another finish line.</em></blockquote>
<blockquote class="subtext"><em>Because I'm always more in love with the person I could be than the person I am.</em></blockquote>

<p>And that is an exhausting way to live.</p>

<p>Because love is beautiful.</p>

<p>Yes, it's uplifting and fulfilling and forgiving, but if you always give it to your future, then you'll never find it in the present, which is where we're all living.</p>

<p>So I think it's time to learn how to fix that.</p>

<blockquote class="subtext"><em>"But I better get to it because now it's already 10:47, and I kinda want to have this all figured out by 11."</em></blockquote>
